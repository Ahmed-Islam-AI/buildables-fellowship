    "\n",
    "- Answer 👉 Define AI by *what it can do* (its capabilities) rather than the exact technique. Users and policymakers care about outcomes like accuracy, safety, and impact. Internally, how it's built matters for engineering and risk, but function-based definitions stay future‑proof as methods change."

    "- Answer 👉 Narrow AI is specialized (chatbots, recommenders, vision models). A true *general AI* would flexibly learn, reason, plan, and transfer skills across domains with minimal data and supervision.

      "🤖 Groq says: **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) are the “contracts” or “gateways” that let two software systems talk to each other. Think of an API as a waiter that takes your order (a request), goes to the kitchen (the underlying code or service), and brings back your food (a response) in a format you can understand.\n",

      "### 1. What is an API?\n",
      "\n",
      "| Term | What it means |\n",
      "|------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Endpoint** | The specific URL or function you hit to perform an action. |\n",
      "| **Request** | The data you send to the API (HTTP headers, query params, body, etc.). |\n",
      "| **Response** | The data the API returns (JSON, XML, plain text, binary, etc.). |\n",
      "| **Protocol** | How the request/response travel – HTTP/HTTPS for web APIs, gRPC, AMQP, etc. |\n",
      "| **Format** | How the data is structured – JSON, XML, Protobuf, etc. |\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of APIs you’ll encounter:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Type | Typical Use |\n",
      "|------|-------------|\n",
      "| **REST** | Stateless, resource‑oriented (most web APIs). |\n",

      "\n",
      "| Benefit | Why it Matters |\n",
      "|---------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Decoupling** | Your front‑end can evolve independently from your back‑end. The two just need to keep their contract (the API) stable. |\n",
      "| **Reusability** | A single API can power multiple clients (web, mobile, IoT, third‑party developers). |\n",
      "| **Scalability** | Micro‑service architectures expose APIs; you can scale each service on its own. |\n",
      "| **Security** | You can centralise authentication, rate‑limiting, and logging at the API layer. |\n",
      "| **Versioning** | New features can be added behind a new API version without breaking existing consumers. |\n",
      "| **Automation** | Scripts, bots, and other systems can interact with your service programmatically. |\n",
      "| **Integration** | External partners can plug into your platform – e.g., payment gateways, CRM systems, analytics services. |\n",

      "1. **Front‑end (React)** calls `/api/products?category=books`.  \n",

      "3. The front‑end renders the list.  \n",
      "4. If you later replace the database or add caching, the front‑end never needs to change because the API contract stays the same.\n",

      "|-----------|--------------|\n",
      "| **Statelessness** | Each request contains all information needed. |\n",
      "| **Idempotency** | Repeating a request yields the same result (e.g., `GET` or `DELETE`). |\n",
      "| **Clear Naming** | Use nouns for resources (`/orders/123`), verbs for actions if necessary (`/orders/123/cancel`). |\n",
      "| **Consistent Error Handling** | Return HTTP status codes and a structured error payload. |\n",
      "| **Documentation** | OpenAPI/Swagger or similar tools keep the contract discoverable. |\n",
      "| **Rate‑Limiting** | Protects against abuse. |\n",
      "| **Security** | OAuth2, JWT, API keys, CORS, HTTPS. |\n",

      "- **Expose business logic** that needs to be reused by multiple teams or partners.  \n",
      "- **Decouple front‑end and back‑end** deployments.  \n",
      "- **Integrate with third‑party services** (e.g., Stripe, Twilio).  \n",
      "- **Implement micro‑services** or serverless functions that talk over HTTP.  \n",

      "APIs let software components interact in a predictable, versioned, and secure way. They’re the backbone of modern web, mobile, and cloud applications, enabling modularity, scalability, and the rapid delivery of new features. Whether you’re building a single‑page app, a micro‑service ecosystem, or a public developer platform, an API is usually the smartest way to expose and consume functionality.\n"
